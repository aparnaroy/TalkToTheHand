# Welcome to Talk to the Hand

## Inspiration
Our inspiration initially came from a TikTok we saw about a deaf girl who was upset that people expected her to read their lips while they talked at her, when they didn't realize how difficult it was for her to do so. When it came time for this hackathon, we did some more research and realized that popular language-learning platforms like Duolingo and Babbel donâ€™t support ASL learning. In addition, existing translators translate letter-by-letter instead of word-by-word.

## What it does
Talk to the Hand is a website that has a live text-to-ASL feature that translates speech / text to ASL and a learning ASL feature for people who want to learn ASL. Two qualities we focused on were accessibility and connectivity. Our website helps people with hearing impairments connect with others and vice versa.

## How we built it
We used React, TypeScript, and Chakra-UI / HTML & CSS in order to build our website. We used GitHub to collaborate and share the progress in our code. We also expanded our skillset by using multiple libraries: 
- react-speech-recognition for speech-to-text conversion
- react-visibility-sensor for animations on scroll
- react-card-flip for flashcard animations

## Challenges we ran into
UI challenges
One of the challenges we ran into was getting the ASL translator to convert from speech or text within the same text box. We decided to prioritize the overall functionality of the website, so we worked around the issue by making the convert from speech a separate area from the text. Another issue we ran into was figuring out how to change state with react/typescript and modifying arrays without crashing the website.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of our live text-to-ASL feature that translates speech / text to ASL. We used the react-speech-recognition library and a growing dictionary of ASL images to make this possible.

## What we learned
We learned several things while working on this project including: effectively incorporating react libraries into our program, how to split code amongst ourselves and focus on our strengths effectively, and how to make the user experience more accessible.  We also learned how to use animations and transitions, and how to design a clean layout to make our website design more aesthetically pleasing. Along the way, we also picked up a little ASL.

## What's next for Talk to the Hand
Our current dataset of word signs is very limited, so we would like to add more commonly used words to the dataset. We also recognize that the sentence structure in ASL varies from that of English, so we would like to update our algorithm to reflect that. In the future, we would like to add more to the learning hub by expanding each lesson set and possibly including a quiz mode.
